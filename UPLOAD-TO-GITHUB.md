# ðŸš€ Upload to GitHub for Automatic APK Build

## Quick Steps

1. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `CodeAgentsMobile`
   - Public repository (for free Actions)
   - Don't initialize with README

2. **Upload Code**:
   ```bash
   cd CodeAgentsMobile-GitHub
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CodeAgentsMobile.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Download APK**:
   - Check "Actions" tab
   - Wait for build to complete (~5-10 minutes)
   - Download from "Artifacts" section

## What Happens Automatically

âœ… **GitHub Actions will**:
- Set up Android build environment
- Build debug APK (for testing)
- Build release APK (optimized)
- Create downloadable releases
- Store APKs as artifacts

âœ… **You get**:
- Ready-to-install APK
- Automatic builds on code changes
- No local Android setup required
- Professional CI/CD pipeline

## Troubleshooting

- **Build fails**: Check Actions logs
- **No artifacts**: Wait for build to complete
- **Can't download**: Make repository public
- **APK won't install**: Enable "Unknown sources" on Android

**Need help?** Check the build logs in the Actions tab!
